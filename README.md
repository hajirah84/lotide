This project was created and published by me as part of my learnings at Lighthouse Labs.

`npm install @hajirahmian/lotide`

**Require it:**

`const _ = require('@hajirahmian/lotide');`

**Call it:**

`const results = _.tail([1, 2, 3]) // => [2, 3]`

## Documentation

The following functions are currently implemented:

- `function1(assertArraysEqual)`: test if two arrays are equal
- `function2 (assertequal))`: test if two assertions are equal
- `function3(assertObjectsEqual)`: test if objects are equal
- `function4(countLetters)`: count the occurences of each letter
- `function5 (countOnly)`: only count the occurences of each key
- `function6(eqArrays)`: check if arrays are equal
- `function7(eqObjects)`: check if objects are equal
- `function8 (findKey)`: find the key in an object
- `function9(findKeyByValue)`: find the key with a given value
- `function10(head)`: find the first index in an array
- `function11(letterPositions)`: find the indices of letters in a given array
- `function12(map)`: an array to map with a callback function
- `function13(middle)`: the middle of an array
- `function14(tail)`: the last items of an array that don't include the first array
- `function15(takeUntil)`: slice of the array with elements taken from the beginning. keep going until the callback/predicate returns a truthy value.
- `function16(without)`: The without function returns a new array with all elements from the source array, except for those that match any elements in the itemsToRemove array.
